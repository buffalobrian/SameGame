- This one gets everything right from the rubric except for a couple pf things. Only feedback is no
instructions (I know the game is super obvious but for the assignment a note about dragging pieces to
their places might be good for full points).
- Also, there isn’t a score like was mentioned in the rubric. So that might be something to add. But make
sure you can’t replace pieces constantly and get more score. Could be a fastest time thing.
